# Error(s) faced this is repository

An issue I had was with the creation of production_patients_medications table.  This table took in two foreign keys as variables.  When I was executing the code, the error that came up was due to the failure of searching the for the foreign key.

I know the table was created because it comes up on the tables lookup.  I'm not sure as to why the erorr is ocurring.  Another table, production_patients_conditions, ran sucessfully while also taking in two foreign keys.  I double checked syntax errors and none where found.
